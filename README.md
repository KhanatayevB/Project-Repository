# Project-Repository



More and more frequently summers in the western US have been characterized by wildfires with smoke billowing across multiple western states. There are many proposed causes for this: climate change, US Forestry policy, growing awareness, just to name a few. Regardless of the cause, the impact of wildland fires is widespread. There is a growing body of work pointing to the negative impacts of smoke on health, tourism, property, and other aspects of society. The course project will require that you analyze wildfire impacts on a specific city in the US. The end goal is to be able to inform policy makers, city managers, city councils, or other civic institutions, to make an informed plan for how they could or whether they should make plans to mitigate future impacts from wildfires.

## Flow of Analysis

Start with downloading the Combined wildland fire datasets for the United States and certain territories, 1800s-Present (combined wildland fire polygons) data, specifically the GeoJSON Files.zip and then the combined dataset. Here is a link: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81
Then You can use that data to run my notebook.

## Given Files

WildFire.zip (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bxl9qrb_52RocKNGfbZ5znHVqFDMkUzf/view?usp=drive_link) - This folder contains multiple files. There are three python files which show how to grab a subset of data, read the data and figure out distances.
Distance Notebook (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNI6hji8CvDeBsnLDAhJXvaqf2gcg8UV/view?usp=drive_link) - This notebook shows how to do the distance calculations
EPA API (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bxl9qrb_52RocKNGfbZ5znHVqFDMkUzf/view?usp=drive_link) - This notebook shows some example code on how to use the API
